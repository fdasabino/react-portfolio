        '"Since 2018, I have the pleasure of having Mr Francisco Sabino in my hotel team, Haymarket, Stockholm. He holds the position of professional bartender at the cocktail bar Americain. Mr Sabino is a very appreciated colleague and he is considered one of our top employees. He is known for providing our guests with professional and caring five star service, and he shares positive energy with the team mates and the guests at the bar. He is punctual and his appearance is always professional, neat and tidy. I have followed Francisco"s studying with interest and I feel proud of how he takes on his life as a dedicated student, while still holding a job at the hotel. With his disciplined hard work and commitment, I am sure Mr Sabino will be appreciated also in his new career as a Fullstack Web Developer."',
